# Mirror to GitLab and trigger GitLab CI

A GitHub Action that mirrors all commits to GitLab, triggers GitLab CI, and returns the results back to GitHub.

A second action uses active polling to determine whether the GitLab pipeline is finished. This means that GitHub Action will only end after the GitLab CI pipeline finished.

## How to use the Gitlab-CI as a contributor

Nothing special. Just contribute to the project as you regularly do
(and as the project requests). Your contributions are automatically
tested in the Gitlab-Repo (once the maintainer approved it).

## How to set up a Gitlab-CI with a Github-Repo (as a maintainer)

Steps to be done:

### Preparation

- Create a new empty repository in a Gitlab-Instance.
- Allow Force-Push on remote protected branches in remote repository.
  - This can be found in Gitlab in `Settings -> Repository -> Protected branches`
- Create Project Access Token in GitLab,
  so that the GitHub-CI can push to GitLab
  - This can be found in Gitlab in `Settings -> Access Tokens -> Project Access Tokens`
  - Give the token a suited name. This name is publicly readable.
  - Set a role of this token (probably `maintainer`,
                              as force-push needs to be possible)
  - This token needs the necessary permissions:
    - api (Read & Write)
    - read_repository
    - write_repository
  - Click `Create project access token`
  - Copy the generated token to the clipboard
- Set the token in Github as a secret
  - In Github `Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret`
  - Set the name as `GITLAB_TOKEN`
  - Paste the token as `secret`
  - Click `Add Secret` to create the new secret

### Gitlab-CI

Add a Gitlab-CI-File called `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
This file is automatically detected by Gitlab
and run when a new commit is done.
This file contains jobs for the Gitlab-CI-Pipeline.

An example for such a file can be found in `examples/.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### Github-CI

- Copy the file `mirror_wait.yml` in `examples/.github/workflows`
to your own repository (in a directory called `.github/workflows`).
This file adds a job that triggers a CI-Pipeline in Gitlab.
- Edit the environment-variables in the file to match your project
  - `GITLAB_HOSTNAME` needs to be the base of the Gitlab-Instance.
  E.g. `codebase.helmholtz.cloud` without https:// in front
  - `GITLAB_REPO_URL` also needs to be without https://,
  but contains the full path of the git-file,
  e.g. `codebase.helmholtz.cloud/j.fritz/github2gitlab_dummy.git`.
  - Set "`GITLAB_PROJECT_ID` to the repository-id
  that can be found in the main page of the repository (named "Project ID")
- The following environment-variables can be kept as they are:
  - `FORCE_PUSH` is set to force-push to the Gitlab-Repo, to make sure,
  the Gitlab-Repo stays in sync with the main GitHub-repository.
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to authorize internal actions. The secret is set automatically by GitHub.
  - `GITLAB_TOKEN` is used to authorize actions with the Gitlab-repo.
  It uses the secret, that was set above.
